## Getting Started
To get started with these mini projects, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/Bhabishworgrg/java-mini-projects.git
```


## Projects
### Project 1: Hello World
  This is a simple "Hello, World!" program that demonstrates the use of different kinds of **print** statements.

### Project 2: Shape Drawer
  A console-based application that prompts the user for a shape and height, then draws that shape with asterisks. This project demonstrates the use of **for loops**.
  #### Allowed Shapes:
  1. **Diamond**:
  - Draws a diamond shape with asterisks.
  - The size must be a positive odd integer.
  2. **Square**:
  - Draws a square shape with asterisks.
  - The size must be a positive integer.
  #### Files:
  - **Driver.java** - The main class that prompts the user for input and draws the specified shape.
  - **ShapeCreator.java** - A class that draws the specified shape.
  - **ErrorHandler.java** - A class that handles errors in the application.
  - **InvalidHeightException.java** - An exception thrown when an invalid height is encountered.
  - **InvalidShapeException.java** - An exception thrown when an invalid shape is encountered.

## Prerequisites
To run these projects, you need to have the [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/downloads/) installed on your machine.

## Running the Projects
- Navigate to the source directory of the project:
```
cd java-mini-projects/src
```
- Compile the Java files using the javac command. For example, to run the *Shape Drawer* project:
```
javac shapedrawer/*.java
```
- Run the compiled Java program using the java command:
```
java shapedrawer.Driver
```
**Note**: Driver class contains the main method and thus is the class to run for every project.
